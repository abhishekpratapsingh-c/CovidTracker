## Inspiration
As a normal person I also searched about **COVID-19** when it was just in some countries, but couldn't find a proper website that gets me all the info about it. So, I decided to make one that has all the latest information about the current pandemic and precautions.


## What it does
This website helps people to find the _screening tool, latest news and statistics of countries, preventive measures, some useful videos on masks and sanitization_. This will help people to be more clear about the prevention of _**Coronavirus**_ and will help in clearing the doubts of people.


## How I built it
I built this website by using **HTML-5, Javascript, Bootstrap and CSS** which is fully responsive for all platforms _(Windows, Android or MacOS)_ so you won't ever miss anything!

I made sure that it should be as fast, smooth and as much informational as it can be.


## Challenges I ran into
I faced some issues understanding how _Javascript_ works, but somehow managed to make it work. Another challenge that i faced was with **Coronavirus Stats Tracker**, most of the trackers were making website slow if embedded but after digging deep, finally found a good widget which works smoothly with my website.



## What I learned
This hackathon gave me an opportunity to get the experience of using web technologies and helped me gain confidence in my skills. It's always good to have new ideas that will help people and in such short time ideas turn out to be really good! It was a great experience which helped me boost my skills.m
